## About Projects-
### The Project folder contains two sub-folder each named after the Tasks completed



## Task 1:- FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION
To run this this project one need to just run the main.py Python script. The libraries that is used to make this project is OpenCV and for the GUI part Tkinter. Tkinter comes default with Python so no config is required for that. One just need to make sure that the current system has openCV. I used haarcascade_frontalface model to detect edges of a human face.
